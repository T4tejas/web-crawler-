A safe, controlled, and customizable web vulnerability assessment crawler designed for authorized security testing.

Missing CSRF token identification

Reflection/encoding checks (SSRF/XSS indicators)

Form & parameter mapping

Cookie attribute inspection

Multi‑domain support

Rotating user‑agents

Generating JSON, HTML, or PDF reports

This is not an exploit tool — it performs non-destructive, passive analysis only.
